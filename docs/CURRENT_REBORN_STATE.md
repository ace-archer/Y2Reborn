# Current Reborn state on the Y2

## Navidrome sync — work in progress (not published; on top of 1.0.0-beta.8.43)

- Settings → Storage → Navidrome: sign in with the server's address, username and password (the full-screen
  keyboard), then Sync Now, Sync Automatically (on Wi-Fi once the last complete sync is 24 h old; retried after 30 min),
  Store On (Internal Storage / SD Card), What to Sync (All Music / Playlists Only) and Quality (Original / MP3 320 /
  MP3 192 kbit/s through the server's transcoder; an MP3 no larger is kept as it is). One-way: the server is the source.
- `reborn_core::navidrome` (choices, `NavidromeRequest` with the password kept out of `Debug`),
  `reborn_platform::navidrome` (Subsonic API 1.16.1: token auth `md5(password + salt)`, the password never stored; the
  address with token on curl's stdin via `--config -`, http or https; `search3` with an empty query pages the library,
  `getPlaylists`/`getPlaylist`, `download` or `stream?format=mp3`), `app/reborn/src/navidrome.rs` (one worker thread at
  lower priority, progress on a channel, the automatic sync). Account 0600 in `/data/reborn/state/navidrome.json`.
- Everything synced lives in `Navidrome/` on the chosen storage: `Artist/Album/NN Title.ext` (FAT-safe names) and
  `Playlists/<name>.m3u8` with relative entries (a server playlist named Favorites is written as `Favorites (Navidrome)`,
  so it is not taken for the player's own), plus `Navidrome/.sync.json` listing what the sync put there (it travels
  with the card). The list is saved at most every 60 s during a sync and on every stop. Only listed files are ever
  replaced or removed; each song is downloaded to a hidden `.part` and renamed whole; at least 256 MiB stay free. Songs the server refuses are counted and tried again next time.
- On the SD card (read-only between writes since Y2Linux 8.27) the whole sync runs inside Reborn's write window:
  `client::SdWriteHold` opens it and asks again every 20 s; Reborn counts its own users of the one `reborn` holder, so a
  playlist change ending its window never closes the card under a sync. A refused window (a card with errors or being
  checked) stops the sync with the playlists' wording; the log carries the underlying error (`detail`).
- Sign-in and sync need Wi-Fi Connected or No Internet (a server at home answers without the internet, as for radio).
  The page's refusals (Connect to Wi-Fi first, Insert a working SD card first, …) show as written, not as
  `friendly_error`'s "Couldn't complete that"; Settings → Last.fm's refusals (Connect to Wi-Fi first, This build has no
  Last.fm key, …) likewise.
- A sync keeps the player awake and Wi-Fi up (`automatic_sleep_tick`, `wifi_idle_tick` count it as work), stops when a
  computer opens the drives or the chosen card goes away, and asks for a quick library scan when it changed anything.
  Wrong login on a sync forgets the account. Disconnect and Reset Settings forget the account; synced music stays.
- Storage's rows shrink from 44 px to fit (Scan, Navidrome and the occasional computer, setup and repair rows). Skin
  layout name `navidrome`. Previews 97–97c. Host tests only; not yet run on a player.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.43 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.43 (Baseline 164), 2026-10-28 (latest): issue fixes

Published as `baseline-164` (Reborn `a08ca5d`, fixes `2eada03`; sequence 11000). #51: Cancel and a held Back leave
Search to the screen it was opened from (the router remembers the Back press; the keyboard's dead `Leave` path is
gone). #45/#46: `albums::unify_album_artists` on the library thread gives songs without Album Artist the album's single
one (same storage, folder, title); `Track::own_album_artist` keeps the tag for Last.fm. #52/#55: `Settings::home_hidden`
(Customize › Home Menu lists every place). #60/#25: `QueueOrigin`; Go to Album becomes Go to Playlist/Folder/Search/
Genre/Songs. #57: skin `remap` recolours warp corners. #56: `AlbumOrder` (Customize › Album Order). #30: letter steps
while the fast-scroll letter shows (`FAST_SCROLL_LINGER` 700 ms). #62: unplug toast. #28: ticks on a computer
connecting and on held seeks (`SEEK_TICK_GAP` 300 ms). Details:

## 1.0.0-beta.8.42 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.42 (Baseline 163), 2026-10-28: sleep, quick scan, report fixes

Published as `baseline-163` (Reborn `25b8e06`; sequence 10900). From the 2026-10-28 review of 40 error reports:
after a Bluetooth loss (a sleep turns Bluetooth off, a link drops) Play with nothing in the jack waits up to 20 s for
those headphones instead of the jack or the speaker (`LostPeer`, `3a4860b`); only the platform's credential reasons
mean a wrong Wi-Fi password, `ap_unavailable` is Network Not Found (`3a4860b`); a Power key still held after a wake
starts a hold (EVIOCGKEY, `13f03d0`); a screen-off refused with EACCES before Reborn set a mode counts as done
(`25b8e06`). Details:
[Y2Linux Beta 8.42 report](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/validation/Y2-LINUX-1.0-BETA-8.42.md).

Sleep (Y2Linux F47/F48): Power turns the screen off at once, as stock, and no longer opens
the Sleep page; a press that wakes the player during the preparation returns where it was; a refused sleep keeps the
screen dark (`57b47b2`, `9ee61f0`; test build 160 on the owner's player).

Quick scan (`c2ef3af`, report `d32f8f3c`: 62–70 s per restart to list 70 500 files on exFAT). `ScanMode` Rebuild /
Walk / Quick in `reborn-library`. The automatic scans (`Scanner::scan`: start, storage change, after a USB copy) are
Quick: a folder whose modification time is unchanged since the last complete walk is not read again while the
storage's free space equals the free space then (`quick_fingerprint`: exFAT or ext4 from mountinfo, FAT32 always
walked whole because other systems leave its free count stale). Skipped folders keep their songs, counts, playlists
and subfolders from the additive tables `scan_folders` / `scan_volumes` (written only after a complete verified walk,
with `METADATA_REVISION`); their rows count as seen, so deleted files are still pruned. Scan for Music and the
control `scan` command are `Scanner::scan_all` (every folder). A tag edit made on a computer that changes neither a
folder's time nor the free space shows after Scan for Music. `scan_completed` gains `quick` and `folders_skipped`.
Tests `quick_scan_tests`; workspace tests, strict Clippy and fmt pass. Device timing owed.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.41 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.41 (Baseline 159), 2026-10-27: internal speaker, haptics

Published as `baseline-159` (Reborn `1358702`; sequence 10700). The Headphone Jack output plays on the internal
speaker while the kernel reads the jack empty (Settings > Sound > Output > Speaker, on by default): `reborn_platform::jack`
(the card's "Y2Audio Headphone" SW events, the DAC on either I2C bus), `SinkSpec.speaker` and native route 2 (Speaker
pin, Master −3 dB), `VolumeRamp::mono` ((L+R)/2: the DAC's speaker route plays the left slot). Headphones in move a
playing speaker to them, headphones out pause; jack changes run as model actions (test build 157 hung at "Starting"
without). Haptics (#28): Customize > Haptics Off/Light/Strong, `reborn_platform::haptics::Motor`, one 60 ms tick per
button press as stock. `rebornctl jack [in|out]` for device tests. Details:

## 1.0.0-beta.8.40 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.40 (Baseline 154), 2026-10-27: identity only

Published as `baseline-154` (Reborn `77c54e2`; sequence 10500). No Reborn change: the release is a kernel fix
(Power Off on a charger restarts into the charging screen, ledger F46). Details:
[Y2Linux Beta 8.40 report](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/validation/Y2-LINUX-1.0-BETA-8.40.md).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.39 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.39 (Baseline 153), 2026-10-26: Folders by file name, Shuffle Albums, playlist Sort, 120 000 songs

Published as `baseline-153` (Reborn `7cf527d`; features `894a99c`; sequence 10470). Folders list folders then songs
by name (`sort::natural_key`), songs by file name (`catalog::Row::FolderTrack`), from `folders::FolderIndex` (per
library: each folder's songs, folders, song count); a song plays its folder in that order, a folder's Play goes
folders first (`FolderIndex::play_order`). `ShuffleMode` Off/Songs/Albums (`settings.shuffle` + `shuffle_albums`,
`queue::album_shuffle`, `shuffle_source_albums`; skins `shuffle_albums`). `PlaylistSort` per playlist
(`settings.playlist_sort`, `Ui::shown_order`). For 120 000 songs: whole-library lists kept per library, album totals,
`Ui::prewarm` while the screen is off, playlists from the scan (`ScanMetrics::playlists`, worker `Job::Known`,
`cache/playlists.json`), search folds names once; metrics `ui_action_ms`, `ui_layout_ms`. Device numbers:

## 1.0.0-beta.8.38 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.38 (Baseline 146), 2026-10-25: Bluetooth pause, live wave

Published as `baseline-146` (Reborn `6c37d9f`; F43 `990443f`; sequence 10310). On Bluetooth, `Runtime::pause`
releases the sink and Play reopens at the position (BlueALSA in-place resumes stayed silent with AirPods Pro 2,
ledger F43). The playing wave (`components::wave_progress`) is an anti-aliased ribbon whose height and ripple follow
`Levels` (bass, mids, highs) measured in the audio thread before the volume (`app/reborn/src/meter.rs`, timed by the
sink delay; `Playback::heard`, `Ui::set_heard`, smoothed by `Ui::wave_levels`); Home's card shows it too.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.37 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.37 (Baseline 144), 2026-10-25: sleep timer, search, scrolling

Published as `baseline-144` (Reborn `69232c2`, sequence 10200). Sleep timer picker (`Modal::SleepTimer`,
`SLEEP_MINUTES` 5 min to 3 h, `minutes_label`; skins `{sleep}`, `"if": "sleep"`, icon `moon`, every shipped skin's
output line), search (#44: `keyboard::Outcome::Leave`, empty start, `Catalog::playlists`, sections of
`SECTION_PREVIEW` with `search_all:<section>`, `Catalog::search_songs`), the playlist page's focus, and one way of
scrolling: headers stay, only lists scroll ([Product UI v4](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V4.md), last sections).
Device-checked on the owner's player.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.36 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.36 (Baseline 138), 2026-10-25: issue fixes, one menu order

Published as `baseline-138` (Reborn `92b9c9a`; fixes `d340263`, redesign `92b9c9a`; sequence 10050). Fixes from the
GitHub issues: `art_key` gives a song without an album its own cover (#43); skins mark Up Next's playing row by queue
entry (`Ui::entry_key`, #60); `keep_up_next_focus` keeps the focused song when rows move, the fallback is the nearest
selectable row (#32); `split_genres`/`Track::genres` and `joined_names` ("A, B") for joined tags (#40). Owner's menu
rules (spec: [Product UI v4](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V4.md), last section): one order in every song and collection menu
(test `every_menu_lists_its_shared_actions_in_one_order`), Up Next Add to Queue (`entries_last`,
`Effect::QueueEntriesLast`), Save Up Next as Playlist… / Clear Queue / Clear Up Next on the song playing, Play and
Shuffle for playlists; Customize: Cover Flow On/Off (albums and audiobooks), Artists All / Album Artists
(`albumartist:` filter, `album_artist_of`), Now Playing Wheel Volume / Seek (`NowPlayingWheel`); album filters carry
a genre (`album_parts`) with Show All N Songs; sheet values and skins' `{detail}` use the room their label leaves
(`Scene::label_end`). Device-checked on the owner's player.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.35 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.35 (Baseline 136), 2026-10-25: louder headphones, safe by default

Published as `baseline-136` (Reborn `e0921a0`, change `5a40103`, sequence 9902). Report F45 (FiiO FH7 too quiet at
High): each `HpLevel` has its own DAC Master (`master_db`: Low −9, Medium −6, High 0 dB → ≈0.35/0.71/1.73 Vrms at
volume 100; Beta 8.5–8.34 held −19.5 dB for all), set by the C sink (`rb_wired_masters`) for the level the amplifier
really runs at, −24 dB until then. The volume is even in dB (`volume_db`: 0.6 dB a step from 10, 3 dB below, −81 dB at
1). Safe level `SAFE_PEAK_DBV` = the old loudest output (−14.7 dBV; safe volume 90/80/67): wired volume up stops
there and opens `ConfirmAction::LoudVolume`; `Settings::loud_ok` lapses after `LOUD_LISTENING_LIMIT_S` (20 h) above
it. `prepare_wired_start` moves an old-scale volume once (`volume_scale`), gives the wired volume back and caps the
start; a return from Bluetooth is capped too; a level change keeps the loudness (`volume_for_level`). Device-checked
on the owner's player (migration, Master per level, warning); output not measured with a meter.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.34 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.34 (Baseline 135), 2026-10-24: MTP fix in the platform

Published as `baseline-135` (Reborn `01f1ed3`, identity only, sequence 9802). The fix is Y2Linux's (#61: MTP no
longer hangs when a computer connects); Reborn is unchanged since 8.33.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.33 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.33 (Baseline 134), 2026-10-24: search page and queue redesign

Published as `baseline-134` (Reborn `eca7f49`, sequence 9702; 8.32 was never published), installed on the owner's
player first. **Search** is one page with the keys over it: first results above the keys, Up/wheel/Search fold the
keys into the results (Artists, Albums, Audiobooks, Songs under headings, Play All), the field brings them back.
**Queue** (`reborn_core::queue`): your queued songs play first (Add to Queue before the rest, Play Next on top),
queue edits, Shuffle and Repeat no longer restart the song (`Playback::set_upcoming`), Repeat All wraps on Next,
Previous restarts the first song, Shuffle on/off reshuffles or restores what plays. **Up Next** opens on the song
playing with a 50-song history above, QUEUE / NEXT FROM headings, Move with the wheel, Select Songs (also Songs,
albums, search), queue actions for albums/artists/genres/folders/search, a NEXT line on Now Playing. Session schema
3 (queue by reference). `rebornctl action NAME` for device tests of hold menus. Also #38 (artists of joined tags).
Design: last two sections of [Product UI v4](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V4.md).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.31 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.31 (Baseline 130), 2026-10-24: left/right balance

Published as `baseline-130` (Reborn `b12a1ee` + identity `b07cb9d`, sequence 9500), installed on the owner's player
first. Settings → Sound → Balance (user request: one ear hears less): `settings.balance` -10..=10 dB (negative = left
louder), applied per channel at the live sink gain (`VolumeRamp::balance`) by lowering the other side, so it never
clips; jack and Bluetooth, live. The list opens on the current value; the Sound page drops its first row once the
focus reaches Balance. Previews 29d, 29e.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.30 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.30 (Baseline 129), 2026-10-24: GitHub triage fixes

Published as `baseline-129` (Reborn `20a493b` + seek fix `44481c3`, sequence 9401), installed on the owner's player
first. Music queues never include audiobook parts (`track_matches` requires `is_music`, `play_index` too; Y2Linux #58);
a song picked on Songs is followed by the next row (`filtered_indices` uses the catalog for Songs; #21); Previous more
than 3 s into a song restarts it (#21), and a pending seek ignores late position reports (the restart kept playing on
in the device test); headphones with AVRCP absolute volume follow `settings.volume` through BlueZ's transport `Volume`
with the software level at full, changes on the headphones come back, `wired_volume` keeps the wired level and the
first takeover never gets louder (#22, not run with real headphones); a toast too long for one line takes two
(16 were cut, Y2Linux #55). Preview 44b.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.29 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.29 (Baseline 128), 2026-10-24: charging fix (platform only)

Published as `baseline-128` (identity `e58980c`, sequence 9300). No Reborn code change: the release fixes charging on
players whose PMIC has no die calibration fuse (Y2Linux kernel, report 09888d70).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.28 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.28 (Baseline 127), 2026-10-23: Wi-Fi wrong password (#20)

Published as `baseline-127` (Reborn `e5b54fb` + identity `f6eb0b2`, sequence 9200), installed on the owner's player
first. #20: a wrong password was saved at once and never said. Now the Wi-Fi worker tries a join before saving it
(`PendingJoin`: ATTACH, SELECT_NETWORK, the supplicant's events; kept only on connect, older entries of the same name
removed, the other saved networks enabled again; a failed try removed and the previous network back). A wrong typed
password reopens the keyboard with the text and *Wrong password*; rows say *Checking password…* / *Wrong password*; a
saved network whose password failed asks for the new one; **Change Password** in its menu; `rebornctl test wifi-join`
and `wifi-join-wrong`.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.27 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.27 (Baseline 126), 2026-10-23: SD cards with errors

Published as `baseline-126` (Reborn `c1e60d6` + identity `4947352`, sequence 9100), installed on the owner's player
first. The platform mounts a FAT32/exFAT card whose check finds errors read-only: `SdCard::ReadOnly` (or `Unchecked`
after an unfinished check) plays, Settings → Storage says *Has errors · Playing only* and offers **Repair SD Card**
(red confirmation; `PlatformTask::SdRepair` stops playback from the card, runs `y2-platform media repair` and names the
outcome); a notice when such a card comes in. A healthy card is read-only between writes: playlist changes on the SD
run inside the platform's write window (`client::sd_write_window`), and a read-only refusal is said plainly.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.26 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.26 (Baseline 125), 2026-10-23: version only (platform report fixes)

Published as `baseline-125` (Reborn `404edb3`, sequence 9000). No Reborn code change: 8.26 fixes platform findings
F35–F41 from uploaded reports (battery start on a charger, Wi-Fi switch-on after a sleep with Wi-Fi off, charging,
shutdown trail, report evidence; see the Y2Linux Beta 8.26 report).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.25 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.25 (Baseline 124), 2026-10-23: version only (#52/#54 kernel fix)

Published as `baseline-124` (Reborn `40386bc`, sequence 8901). No Reborn code change: 8.25 changes how the kernel starts
the DAC's crystal (#52, #54; see the Y2Linux Beta 8.25 report).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.24 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.24 (Baseline 123), 2026-10-23: wired output at 44.1 kHz only (#52)

Published as `baseline-123` (Reborn `e199d9c`, sequence 8800), installed on the owner's player before publishing. #52:
every failure was a 48 kHz start through the DAC's PLL, which stock never runs (stock output: 44.1 kHz only). The wired
plan always asks for `reborn_audio::WIRED_RATE` (44.1 kHz) and the decoder converts other rates; the kept-sink rule is
now "wired, 44.1 kHz", so tracks of any rate play on in the open sink (device: 50 reuses across 48/44.1 kHz, 0
reopens). The per-rate `wired_plan`, the rate fallback and the unused rate arguments are gone.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.23 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.23 (Baseline 122), 2026-10-22: output kept, DAC hold, update task queue

Published as `baseline-122` (Reborn `0779d8b`, sequence 8705), installed on the owner's player before publishing.
#52/#54: the wired sink stays open across track changes with the same output, rate, format and wired settings (old
audio dropped, 10 ms fade-in, closed 2 s after the last stream or at Stop; `audio/sink_reused`, `audio/sink_reopened`),
and `power::dac_hold` keeps the DAC powered through the kernel's `y2_hp/hold` from startup/screen wake to screen-off
(`dac_hold` on `screen_wake`/`screen_blank`). F33: Update Now waits for the platform worker's next turn; the update
screen gives up after 30 s without a task. Device: 17/17 same-format skips reused the output, hold follows the screen.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.22 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.22 (Baseline 121), 2026-10-22: Date & Time, report fixes

Published as `baseline-121` (Reborn `e196033`, sequence 8607), installed on the owner's player before publishing.
Settings → Display → Date & Time sets the clock by hand (#53; read-only while the clock is network time). Report
fixes: a busy wired output is retried for 2 s inside the open deadline and names its holder (F24), an unknown codec
outcome clears when the headphones drop or reconnect (F25), Pair waits for the reconnect owner (F28), a cancelled
pre-open no longer logs every queued track (F29). The headphone crystal changes (#52/#54) are the kernel's.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.21 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.21 (Baseline 120), 2026-10-22: headphone crystal run as stock (#52, #54)

Published as `baseline-120` (Reborn `cdc6b43`, sequence 8500), installed on the owner's player before publishing. No
Reborn code change (identity only): the fix is the kernel's (Y2Linux overlay 0030: the CS43131 crystal starts with the
codec and is used after 1 s like stock, codec autosuspend 5 s). The 5-s sink open deadline of 8.20 covers the 1-s wait.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.20 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.20 (Baseline 119), 2026-10-22: headphone crystal (#52)

Published as `baseline-119` (Reborn `cdae78e`, sequence 8400), installed on the owner's player before publishing. The
sink open deadline is 5 s (`34a07b6`): on a player whose CS43131 crystal misses its start, the kernel's tries and rail
cycle take ≈1.4–1.9 s per open and the sink opens twice, so 2 s gave up during the second open (#52). The crystal
itself is the kernel's (Y2Linux overlay 0030: 15 µA bias after a failure).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.19 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.19 (Baseline 118), 2026-10-21: audiobooks, covers, Customize

Published as `baseline-118` (Reborn `da5b777`, sequence 8302; 8.18 was a test build, never published), installed on
the owner's player before publishing. Audiobooks (`11febec`…`da5b777`, plan, code map and device test in
[REBORN-AUDIOBOOKS](ui/REBORN-AUDIOBOOKS.md)): `reborn_core::books` (detection by folder/`.m4b`/genre, grouping, natural
order, chapters, `Listening`, `Shelf` in `state/books.json`, rewind), `rb_media_chapters`, `admit_streams` (cover video
track), `av_max_alloc` 128 MiB (long M4B), `heavy_mp4` scan, `RbDspConfig.speed` with `atempo`, sleep timer
(`sleep_timer.rs`), Home/list/book page/Now Playing/skins (`views_books.rs`). Covers (`4895db4`): art 180, thumbs 128
from the picture, CPU half/quarter levels (`level_block`/`level_source`), centre crop, Lanczos, 4:2:0 LRU cache of 3 000.
Customize (`820fa50`): Wrap Around; When Screen Off and the 15-min headset grace (`ad4fdba`).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.17 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.17 (Baseline 114), 2026-10-21: report fixes

Published as `baseline-114` (Reborn `6d5458c`, sequence 8100). Bluetooth (`6a31a53`): a disconnect seen in either of
two snapshots of a tick is kept (`bt_lost |=`), `StartDiscovery` 15 s with InProgress/late NoReply as scanning, intents
go to `/run/y2/bt-intent/bt-control.ini` (the reconnect owner never read `/run/y2`), `BusyRetry` for a busy lock or a
busy BlueZ Connect answer (45 s window), a definite failure writes `failed` (only NoReply/timeouts `uncertain`). Player
(`d6523b5`): a Play refused for a missing A2DP peer pauses as a disconnect; `SdCard::CheckTimedOut` and refused-card
wording instead of "Reinsert"; BlueALSA drain -EIO leaving SETUP is a pause; radio `sniff()` for text/bytes playlists,
`station_failed` with HTTP status and content type; one renderer off/on retry for a failed frame within 30 s of a wake
(main loop only, not inside `sleep_restore`).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.16 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.16 (Baseline 113), 2026-10-20: large libraries

Published as `baseline-113` (Reborn `eea9312`, sequence 8000). From a 28 600-song report: `MAX_QUEUE` is 5 000
(`queue_window`: the chosen song with a tenth before it; Shuffle a random 5 000; `play_members` picks positions before
cloning; `AppModel::restore` trims an older larger queue) (`122607f`). The scan probe takes matching ids from its
indexed lookup instead of an `INSERT…SELECT` planned as a walk over the whole source (749 s of a 759 s no-change
rescan) (`5c7e768`). Tags of new/changed files are read by `read_parallel` on up to 3 threads (`scan_workers`, after
the LibraryScan lease restored the cores; `reborn_platform::lower_thread_priority` nice 10), applied in file order
(`4922cab`).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.15 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.15 (Baseline 112), 2026-10-20: CJK text, update check, codec retry

Published as `baseline-112` (Reborn `2ef41d3`, sequence 7900). Text lookup is exact face → fallback page → Noto Sans
CJK (`/usr/share/fonts/noto-cjk/NotoSansCJKjp-Regular.otf`, `REBORN_CJK_FONT` overrides) → U+FFFD; missing glyphs are
rasterised at the face's size into a runtime 1024² A8 page (`reborn-graphics/src/glyphs.rs`, `reborn-ui/src/glyph_cache.rs`,
texture slot 9, LRU shelves, ≤ 48 new glyphs a frame), font memory-mapped on first need (`a3b1943`). A failed update
check flashes *Couldn't reach the update server* and the page keeps Update Now; `network_not_online` maps to
NeedsNetwork (`cdf8c7b`). The Bluetooth worker retries a codec choice refused while the peer is still connecting
(2 s, 5 tries; `b8cd9a7`). Not run on a player before publishing (owner updates by OTA).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.14 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.14 (Baseline 111), 2026-10-20: shuffle, seek, genre Shuffle, titles

Published as `baseline-111` (Reborn `5cda8bb`, sequence 7800; changes in `2861ec9`). `play_members` seeded its
Fisher-Yates shuffle from the selected track's ID and index, and Shuffle rows always selected the first member, so every
Shuffle played one fixed order: now `reborn_platform::random_u64()` (getrandom) seeds a splitmix64 shuffle, a Shuffle
row (`force_shuffle`) shuffles every member, a song picked with Shuffle on stays first. `Effect::Seek` carries only the
direction; `seek_step` sizes held-seek steps 1 s → 3 s (after 1.5 s) → 10 s (after 4 s), at most 1/60 of the song
(was 30 s every 90 ms). A genre's album list has Shuffle (`shuffle:collection`) under All Songs, also skipped by Cover
Flow's album detail. The Home card's title is fitted to 200 px. Owner checked all four on build 111.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.13 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.13 (Baseline 110), 2026-10-20: library tags over MTP

Published as `baseline-110` (Reborn `21cd3b0`, sequence 7701); no Reborn source change besides the identity. Y2Linux's
MTP responder (umtprd overlay 0005) now reads Reborn's library read-only (`/data/reborn/library.db`: `tracks` joined to
online `sources` by absolute `path`, `deleted=0`) to report title, artist, album, album artist, track, duration, sample
rate, channels and bitrate to libmtp clients such as Strawberry. **The `tracks`/`sources` columns it reads are now an
interface:** renaming them falls back to file names over MTP (no failure). Pause/resume silence on wired output was the
#48 crystal path on the reopen after a 180 s hold, fixed in 8.12 and checked on a player.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.12 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.12 (Baseline 108), 2026-10-20: playlist crash loop, crash isolation, audio open retry

Published as `baseline-108` (Reborn `90f3da6`, sequence 7601). An M3U line with a multi-byte character across byte 8
(`’`, `º`) panicked the playlists thread at `reborn-platform/src/playlists.rs:223` (`trimmed[..8]`) on every scan with
the SD card; the panic hook ends the process, so three players crash-looped and updates rolled back (Y2Linux #49).
Fixed there and in `reborn-ui/src/playlist_index.rs` (`text[..7]`, `percent_decode`) (`3ff346a`).
`reborn_observability::isolated()` turns a panic on one user file into an error: the hook writes `panic-last.json`
with `"isolated": true` and returns instead of `exit(101)`; used per playlist file/job, per cover decode and per
scanned song (`bc2762d`, test `crates/reborn-observability/tests/isolated_panic.rs`). A refused output open is tried
once more after 250 ms (CS43131 crystal, Y2Linux #48; `2db37cf`). Test build 107 on the maintainer's player: crash
playlists listed and opened, no panic.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.11 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.11 (Baseline 106), 2026-10-20: storage setup waiting for a charger

Published as `baseline-106` (Reborn `727fd47`, sequence 7500). `InternalSetup::Pending` carries `SetupWait` from the
platform's reason: `battery_low`/`battery_unknown` → Settings → Storage says **Connect a charger and restart**;
anything else (an update's health boot) keeps *Restart to finish setting up*. Before, every Pending said restart, and a
user restarted on battery again and again without the setup ever running (Y2Linux report 20261019-153610; the platform
gate is now 25 % by power-on OCV). Preview `32-storage-setup-battery`; tests in `client.rs` and
`internal_storage_setup_is_offered_only_for_a_waiting_old_library_and_confirmed_red`. Not checked on a player.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.10 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.10 (Baseline 105), 2026-10-19: report progress, no topic, uploads

Published as `baseline-105` (Reborn `cfac12b`, sequence 7400), with the uploads entry below.

### Report progress, no topic

Send Report Now sends at once: `PlatformTask::ReportSend` has no topic, `Screen::ReportTopic` and `ReportTopic`
are gone (every report holds everything). While a report is made, About & Updates → Error Reports shows its live
progress like the update download: `client::report_progress` reads Y2Linux's `/run/y2/report-progress.json` every
200 ms while `ReportSend`/`ReportSave` run (`PlatformState::report`, `ReportLive`, `ReportStep`), and
`views_settings::report_progress` draws the steps Collect · Clean · Send (or Save), the percent, the gliding bar,
what happens ("260 of 504 KB", "Into the Error Reports folder.") and the time left; before the first record
"Starting…" sweeps. Previews 33f, 33l–33o; test `a_running_report_shows_its_steps_percent_and_what_happens`; 545
tests, strict Clippy.

### Uploads

With the platform's uploader (Y2Linux ERROR-REPORTS-PLAN R4): Send Report Now flashes "Report sent" when the
report went out at once (`last.state == "sent"` in the reply), "Report saved · waiting to send" otherwise; the page
names a dropped report (refused by the receiver or unsent after three days) as "couldn't be sent". The switch,
Send Report Now, the install ID and the question appear when the image carries the upload key (`upload: true`).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.9 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.9 (label 102), 2026-10-19: Save Report without a topic

Built and installed on the owner's player, not published (Reborn `4da5f84`, sequence 7100). Save Report asks only for the storage: `report_dest:<destination>` returns to the Error Reports page and starts
`PlatformTask::ReportSave(destination)` (`y2-platform report save --to …`, no `--topic`). The topic never changed a
report's content (`report.py` collects the same sections for every topic; it was only a label in `report.json`),
and a saved report goes with a GitHub issue that says what went wrong. `Screen::ReportTopic` stays for Send Report
Now, where the topic is the only thing the owner tells the receiver. The storage rows lose their chevron. Test
`without_an_uploader_reports_are_saved_to_the_chosen_storage` updated; 543 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.8 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.8 (Baseline 101), 2026-10-19: Save Report

Published as `baseline-101` (Reborn `b6b6fbc`, sequence 7000), with the error report screens below. About & Updates →
Error Reports → **Save Report** → storage (`ReportState::destinations`, `report_dest:<internal|sd>`) → topic
(`Screen::ReportTopic`, filter `save:<destination>`) → `PlatformTask::ReportSave(topic, destination)` →
`y2-platform report save --to … --topic …`; afterwards back on the Error Reports page, which shows the progress and
"Last report saved to …". While the platform says `upload: false` (no uploader yet), the page shows only Save Report
and What Is Saved, About & Updates shows no On/Off and `ask_about_reports()` asks nothing. A report takes ≈10 s.
Test `without_an_uploader_reports_are_saved_to_the_chosen_storage`, previews 33h–33k; 543 tests, strict Clippy.

## Error reports screens (2026-10-18; on the owner's player as test build 98, released in 8.8)

Reborn `8ba33b3` and `fbecb77` (versions 1.0.0-beta.8.8 test builds 97–98, not published). Plan: Y2Linux
`docs/planning/ERROR-REPORTS-PLAN.md`.

- About & Updates → **Error Reports** (`Screen::ErrorReports`, filter `info` for What Is Sent): the switch
  (`PlatformTask::ReportEnable`), Send Report Now (`Screen::ReportTopic`, seven `ReportTopic`s →
  `PlatformTask::ReportSend`), the install ID (`ReportState::short_id`, New ID confirm → `ReportNewId`), the last
  report's state. The row is hidden on platforms without `y2-platform report`.
- The platform refresh also reads `y2-platform report status` (`client::report_state`, `PlatformSnapshot::reports`);
  report tasks answer `client::Reply::Reports`. One observation runs 20 s after start on any screen.
- One-time question `ConfirmAction::ReportsQuestion` ("No Thanks" / "Send Reports", both recorded), opened by
  `ask_about_reports()` only on a lit screen, with no other dialog and 5 s without a button press.
- Previews 33b–33g; tests `error_reports_page_switches_sends_and_names_the_last_report`,
  `the_error_report_question_records_no_as_well_as_yes`, `report_status_is_read_from_the_platform_record`.
  542 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.7 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.7 (Baseline 95), 2026-10-18 (latest): identity only

Published as `baseline-95` (Reborn `82fe089`, sequence 6900). No Reborn change: the release identifies GC9503V
players from LK's panel name (Y2Linux kernel, #45/#46).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.6 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.6 (Baseline 94), 2026-10-18: audio playback review

Published as `baseline-94` (Reborn `cefcc8a`, sequence 6800). Device results: Y2Linux Beta 8.6 report (test build 94
on the owner's player = the release: profile list, `dsp_rise_fade`, `fade_continued` after Next, `pause_released`, no
restart for the same level; CPU floor 598 MHz with a profile instead of 747.5, ≥16 % fewer decode-thread cycles).
Findings and answers: Y2Linux handoff and audits AUDIO-REVIEW-8.5 / BETA-8.6.

- **Fades:** an unfinished fade-in carries into a reopened sink (Next, a seek, another rate: `opening_gain`,
  `VolumeRamp::fade_in_from`, `fade_progress`), and volume up during a fade keeps fading towards the new volume
  (volume down still acts at once). A load whose sound settings play ≥ 1 dB louder somewhere than the previous
  load's fades in over 2 s too (`dsp_rise_fades`, `reborn_core::eq::level_rise_db`, `LoadRequest::fade_in`,
  event `dsp_rise_fade`): a profile turned off (its preamp and cuts come back), a boosting preset, any Normalize
  change. Not the first load after start (it plays what was saved, as the level does).
- **Held pause:** every sound-settings change (`reload_dsp`, now also Normalize and Reset Settings) releases a held
  pause, so Play starts with the new settings instead of the old level/EQ. Choosing the Headphone Level already in
  use does nothing (it restarted the song).
- **Battery:** an equalizer or profile no longer asks for `PlaybackHeavy` (747.5 MHz floor, 1 ms wake-up limit
  that blocks deep idle); only crossfade does (`Settings::playback_heavy`). The FFmpeg graph uses one thread
  (`media.c`): host, FFmpeg 9.0.2, HD 650, 5 min: 43 % (1152-sample frames) / 20 % (4096) less CPU,
  bit-identical output. Device mA and CPU owed.
- **Profiles:** the clip-safe preamp now covers source rates 44.1–384 kHz (filters run before resampling): six
  shipped profiles 0.1–0.4 dB lower (Sony WF-1000XM4 −7.7 → −8.1, HD 650 unchanged −6.4); a stored profile is
  re-sanitized at start. Rates below 44.1 kHz stay out (FFmpeg skips filters above Nyquist; covering them would
  lower many profiles by up to 6 dB); the limiter covers them. The shipped folder lists only `*ParametricEQ.txt`
  (the license file appeared as a profile "LICENSE-AutoEq").
- **Tests:** layout of `RawDspConfig`/`RawParams` pinned on both sides (`_Static_assert` + `const` assert),
  sanitize idempotence over all shipped profiles, `preamp_covers_hi_res_source_rates`, a full HD 650 profile with
  ReplayGain +6 dB on the new near-full-scale fixture `loud-24-96000-rg.flac` at S24 and S16 (limiter holds
  ≤ 0.981, mutation without the limiter clips), the real shipped-folder scan (47, no license), fade/opening
  gain, DSP rise. 539 tests, fmt, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.5 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.5 (Baseline 93), 2026-10-18: headphone level, headphone profiles, DAC filter

- Needs Y2Linux's `HP Output Level` kernel control (older kernels: Master stays −24 dB) and FFmpeg's
  `lowshelf`/`highshelf` (Y2Linux `docs/HEADPHONE-OUTPUT.md`). Device results: Y2Linux Beta 8.5 report (test
  builds 91–93 on the owner's player).
- **Headphone Level** (Settings → Sound → Output): `Settings::hp_level` (Low default = stock level, Medium, High), passed to
  `reborn_audio::wired_configure` at startup and on a change. `rb_sink_open` sets the kernel controls before
  the stream starts, sets Master to −19.5 dB with the control (−24 dB without it) and reads `HP Output Level Live`
  after the pin switch. A higher level fades in over 2 s (`VolumeRamp::fade_in`, `Parameters::level_raised`,
  `rb_wired_note_live`; also when the rise was chosen with no stream since boot). A change restarts wired
  playback and releases a held pause.
- **DAC Filter** (Settings → Sound → Output): `Settings::dac_filter` (Fast, Fast/Slow phase compensated, Slow,
  Nonoversampling), set live through the upstream controls.
- **Headphone Profile** (Settings → Sound → Equalizer): `reborn_core::eq` parses AutoEQ / Equalizer APO
  `ParametricEQ.txt` (PK, LSC, HSC with Q, OFF lines and comments skipped, anything else refused, ≤ 10 filters).
  The clip-safe preamp is min(file preamp, −peak of the combined RBJ response from 10 Hz to Nyquist at 44.1/48 kHz),
  rounded down to 0.1 dB. Files come from `EQ` folders on Internal Storage and SD cards; `Settings::eq_profile`
  keeps a copy and `eq_profile_on` plays it instead of the five bands (a preset or a band edit turns it off).
  47 AutoEq profiles of common headphones and IEMs ship in `assets/eq` (pinned AutoEq commit, MIT,
  `SOURCES.md`, refetch with `tools/assets/fetch_eq_profiles.py`; test `shipped_profiles_all_import`), installed to
  `/usr/share/reborn/eq` and listed with the storage `EQ` folders (a storage file replaces a shipped one by name).
  Engine: `EqBand::kind`, 10 bands across the FFI, `DspConfig::preamp_db` in the gain stage before the filters,
  `equalizer`/`lowshelf`/`highshelf` in the graph, limiter unchanged. The equalizer curve shows the profile's
  response.
- Sound stays one screen (owner chose layout C of three): Equalizer, Normalize, Gapless, Crossfade and the
  Output card ("Level Low · Filter Fast" for the jack). The card opens `Screen::Output`: the outputs (current one
  checked, replacing the output modal there) and a Headphone Jack group with Level and DAC Filter (pickers
  `HeadphoneLevel`, `DacFilter`; skin layouts `output`, `headphone_level`, `dac_filter`). Settings → Sound names an
  active profile. Previews 27-sound, 27b-output, 27c-sound-wired, 28-equalizer, 28b, 28c, 29b, 29c. 529 tests, strict
  Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.4 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.4 (Baseline 90), 2026-10-18 (latest): restart display fix

- No Reborn code change; the release carries Y2Linux's fix for the dark display after a restart (SMI gates reopened
  as the last step of a restart). A dark start had made Reborn's first frame time out and an update roll back.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.3 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.3 (Baseline 89), 2026-10-18: seconds left

- *Checking the Update* shows the seconds left from the core's check line (`"<percent> check <seconds>"`, Y2Linux
  8.3, `reborn_platform::client::parse_download`); with an older core it keeps *This takes a few seconds.* The
  install itself runs in the recovery, whose screen now also shows the seconds left.

## 1.0.0-beta.8.2 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.2 (Baseline 88), 2026-10-18: faster updates

- No Reborn code change; the release carries Y2Linux's four-core installer and kept rollback copy (OTA-50). The
  update screen's steps are unchanged; the install step now takes about 15 s on the owner's player (was 54 s).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.1 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.1 (Baseline 86), 2026-10-18: panel power-down

- No Reborn code change; the release carries Y2Linux's panel power-down at screen-off (#45) for the ST7701S panel.
  Screen-on after a screen-off now includes the panel's stock initialization (≈0.5 s).

## 1.0.0-beta.8.0 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.0 (Baseline 75), 2026-10-18: 1.0 review fixes

- Library: a supported file FFmpeg cannot open is counted (`ScanMetrics::unreadable`, `ScanSummary::unreadable`,
  Settings → Library *N can't be read*), keeps its row through `DbCommand::Retain` and no longer makes the scan
  incomplete, so deleted songs are pruned again and `library.error` stays clear; failures are remembered per process
  (`Unreadable` set), a rebuild retries them. Before, one such file rolled every Y2Linux update back (V1 review B3/B4).
- `rebornctl status`: `healthy` and `health_reasons` (graphics, database, stuck workers; not scan completeness), which
  Y2Linux's update health check now reads (R7).
- A refused session is kept as `session.json.rejected-<time>`; `recover_settings` keeps every setting this version
  understands (B7). Wired audio profile matches whole rates (R4). 517 tests. Device: OTA-installed and acknowledged on
  the owner's player with a broken file on Internal Storage.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.11 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.11 (Baseline 74), 2026-10-17: faster copies to the player

- No Reborn code change; the release carries Y2Linux's multi-packet USB receive DMA (copies to the player ≈30 MB/s on
  Internal Storage instead of ≈10). New songs still reach the library through the existing change detection.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.10 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.10 (Baseline 73), 2026-10-17: USB file operations

- No Reborn code change; the release carries Y2Linux's musb fix for the zero-length-packet crash and MoveObject/CopyObject
  in the MTP responder. Reborn's library follows moves and copies through the existing durable-change generations.
  514 tests.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.9 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.9 (Baseline 72), 2026-10-17: Internal Storage setup, #39, #44

- `platform::InternalSetup` (Unknown · NotNeeded · Pending · Waiting{files, bytes} · Running · Done{kept} · Failed) from
  `storage.internal_setup`; `PlatformTask::InternalStorageSetup` → `y2-platform internal-media setup --confirm-shown`.
- One-time question (`Settings::internal_setup_asked`) for a large old library; Settings → Storage row *Set Up Internal
  Storage* (red, enabled only while Waiting, refused while a computer is connected, restarts the player after); Storage
  card *Not set up · Your old files are kept* / *Restart to finish setting up*; message *Internal Storage is ready ·
  Kept N files in Old Player Files*; boot phases `media_setup*` (word stages, no numbers on the boot screen).
- Radio firmware page names the Firmware folder on Internal Storage or the Firmware drive and *Not Enough Space for That
  File* (#39); `SdCard::NeedsRepair` *Needs repair · Check it on a computer* (#44). Previews 32-storage-setup-*,
  32-firmware-no-space, 32-storage-sd-repair. Device: the automatic setup passed on the owner's player.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.8 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.8 (Baseline 71), 2026-10-16: Last.fm fixes

- Now Playing re-announced after a pause, a repeat or a failed attempt (`announce_due`, ≤ every 30 s per play); a play
  refused with Last.fm error 6 no longer blocks the queue; sign-in and Now Playing wait for a trusted clock; one sign-in
  request at a time; radio/clock/platform/lastfm/scrobble log events reach the log (allowlist guard test).
  Device: QR sign-in and real scrobbles confirmed on 7.7.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.7 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.7 (Baseline 70), 2026-10-16: Last.fm scrobbling

- `reborn_core::scrobble` (half or 4 min heard, seeks/pauses add nothing, radio/untagged never), `reborn_platform::scrobble`
  (fsynced locked JSONL queue, `drop_sent`, Rockbox log, clock trust, CLOCK_BOOTTIME), `reborn_platform::lastfm` (own MD5,
  curl form on stdin, QR token flow + mobile-session fallback, batches of 50, back-off with random spread),
  `app/reborn/src/scrobbling.rs`, Settings → Last.fm with an own QR encoder (native in every skin). App key from
  `/usr/share/reborn/lastfm-api.json` (release image); session 0600 on Y2DATA. Previews 96–96d. 509 tests, strict Clippy.
- Device: QR sign-in and the first real scrobble confirmed (2026-10-16); offline play sent after sleep still owed.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.6 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.6 (Baseline 67), 2026-10-16: smooth update screens

- Owner: low fps on the update download. Cause: download/check counted only as `spinning` (calm 34-ms frame gap, ≤ 29
  fps). `Ui::download_shown` (visible, screen on) joins `gliding()` but not `responding()` (no CPU lease); the percentage
  follows `download_fill`; the sweep fades at its ends; Connecting eases.
- `views_settings::steps` (Download · Check · Install) replaces "STEP 1 OF 3", also on `views_system::installing`;
  10-px bar with a bright head. Preview `34d-update-installing`. 489 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.5 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.5 (Baseline 66), 2026-10-16: larger status bar, Skin in Settings

- Status bar layout C (owner's choice of four rendered variants): `status_bar` draws the Title Case name beside the
  back arrow (SemiBold 15, white; call sites no longer uppercase), `status_cluster(.., roomy)` returns its left edge
  (clock S15, % S13, icons 18 px, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth 22 px, battery 25 × 13); skins keep `roomy: false`.
  `components::home_bar`: "Reborn" + `short_version`. Message pill 30 px, SemiBold 15.
- Theme → **Skin**, a Settings row of its own (seven 44-px rows, `Icon::Palette` added by
  `tools/assets/build_ui_assets.py`; font pages unchanged); Display without the scroll rail; About's Music Library row
  removed (count on Storage → Scan for Music); `Skins` folders read besides `Themes`. 487 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.4 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.4 (Baseline 65), 2026-10-16: status-bar messages, cooler wave

- `components::toast`: a 26-px pill in the status bar with `toast_icon` (subject icon; red warning for problems); the
  StatusBar mark's quads (title and status cluster, not the back arrow) are hidden while it shows. Owner chose this
  placement (C) over below-the-bar (A) and bottom (B).
- `Ui::responding()` (button-started motion: Cover Flow, slides, settling springs) drives the Interactive CPU lease;
  `gliding()` (incl. the playing wave) only the frame pacing. The wave alone runs at the lowest clock.
- Measured on 7.3: 62 fps median while moving, 64–65 fps wave, 0 missed, 0 fps at rest. 487 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.3 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.3 (Baseline 64), 2026-10-16: USB message and symbol

- Owner: the locked computer screen (7.1) kept the player unusable while connected; a message and a status-bar symbol
  instead. `Ui::observe` flashes "Connected to a computer" / "Copying files from the computer…"; `status_cluster` draws
  `Icon::Usb` while Ready/Copying (accent while copying). Removed: `usb_overlay`, `views_system::usb`, the input lock,
  `usb_dismissed`, `Settings::usb_developer` and "Use While Connected". 487 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.2 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.2 (Baseline 63), 2026-10-16: motion and the Now Playing wave

- Owner: more animation for a polished, responsive feel, at 60 fps; the progress as a wave, not a perfect sine.
- `motion.rs`: per-key eased values (QUICK/CALM), retargetable, frame-rate independent; `Motion::moving()` and
  `mark_live` feed `Ui::gliding()`, i.e. Cover Flow's 12-ms frame gap and Interactive lease; at rest nothing redraws.
  `Ui::ui_motion` (runtime on; previews/tests off); `reborn-preview --motion` captures frames mid-animation.
- Components mark moving quads (`canvas::Moving`), eased by `motion::apply`: focus row and Home marker glide; smooth list
  scrolling (±1 extra row, hidden at rest, status bar kept above; long jumps glide one row); sheets rise; dialogs and toasts
  fade in; switches slide. `Ui::slide_screens`: screens slide (200 ms), skins included.
- Now Playing: `shown_position` moves on between reports; `components::wave_progress` (travelling, imperfect wave; flat
  when paused); a new song fades in; the play button dips on a change.
- 487 tests, strict Clippy. Device frame rate owed.

## 1.0.0-beta.7.1 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7.1 (Baseline 62), 2026-10-16: one-step update, USB screen, time zone

- **Update:** the check's reply sets Up to Date / Available at once (it waited for the next status refresh). Update Now /
  Install Now (`Ui::update_run`) download, check and restart to install on one screen that cannot be left, after the charge
  rule; Cancel = `Effect::CancelDownload` → `client::abort_download()` → SIGTERM to `update stage` (platform cleans up
  until its commit point). Three-step progress.
- **USB:** `client::usb_now()` (UDC sysfs + `/run/y2/usb-transfer.json`) every 0.5 s on every screen (the status was only
  refreshed on Settings screens); the screen lights when a computer opens the drives; the computer screen keeps
  Back/Home/Select while connected; `Settings::usb_developer` (service page "Use While Connected") lifts that.
- **Time zone:** `Settings::time_zone_auto` (`zone_auto()`: on where none was chosen); `reborn_platform::geo::zone()` once
  per Wi-Fi network (ipapi.co, ipwho.is), only table zones; picker Automatic, UTC, countries A–Z
  (`reborn_core::clock::countries`, generated by `tools/clock/countries.py`), cities only where they keep different times.
- 483 tests, strict Clippy. Device checks owed (Y2Linux Beta 7.1 report).

## 1.0.0-beta.7 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 7 (Baseline 61), 2026-10-16: UI v4

- Owner: the UI looked full and rough after playlists, search and radio; make it consistent and for listeners. Review,
  owner decisions and every phase: [Product UI v4](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V4.md).
- **One system:** a fixed accent (`Ui::accent`) for controls and state, the cover's colour (`Ui::cover_accent`) only on Now
  Playing and the Home cover card; `components::focus_row`, `button`, `empty_state`/`Mark`, `menu_entry`; one LIVE badge.
  Skins are drawn with the cover accent as before.
- **Home and Music:** Home is Now Playing, Music, Playlists, Radio, Search, Settings; Music lists Artists, Albums, Songs,
  Genres, Folders with counts; Settings → Display → Home Menu pins lists (`Settings::home_pins`, `Effect::SetHomePin`,
  `Screen::HomeMenu`). Display scrolls past the brightness card.
- **Less on screen:** no hint lines (hold menus name the actions), no NOW PLAYING label, gapless icon or radio codec tags;
  stations "Country · Genre" without ranks; Bluetooth Connected/Paired, Wi-Fi Saved/Secured/Open; folder roots show songs;
  theme swatches (`SkinInfo::swatch`); Storage bars + Scan, About "1.0 Beta 7" + Music Library; Normalize.
- 479 tests, strict Clippy; previews of 114 states and 16 skins compared by eye. Device tour with screen capture owed.

## 1.0.0-beta.6.3 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 6.3 (Baseline 60), 2026-10-16: sleep while paused

- Owner: Power while paused "does not go to sleep … finishing another task". Device journal (6.2, battery): four requests
  refused `activity_operation:808/reborn` (Reborn's PID). An open sink holds a shared flock on `/run/y2/activity.lock`
  (`audio.c` `rb_sink_open`); pause in place keeps the sink open up to 3 minutes; the platform takes its operation locks
  before it asks Reborn to prepare, so `prepare_sleep`'s release came too late.
- A sleep request (Power or automatic) now releases a held pause and waits for the sink to close first
  (`release_hold_with(true)` → `Playback::stop_and_wait`); Play then restarts at the same place. Platform refusals are
  logged (`power/sleep_refused`); the release logs `pause_released` with `for_sleep`. Device check owed.

## 1.0.0-beta.6.2 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 6.2 (Baseline 59), 2026-10-16: clock, skins for the newer screens, Bunny Bow

- **Clock** (PR #10 by samanz, reviewed and merged): the time in the status bar in a zone chosen under Settings →
  Display → Time Zone. `reborn_core::clock` converts UTC with each zone's POSIX TZ rule (`zones.rs`, generated by
  `tools/clock/zones.py` from tz 2026c; the image ships no zone database); DST, half-hour and southern zones tested;
  hidden while the system time reads before 2025; 12-hour in zones where that is usual (no switch). Reborn's
  follow-up: the text is made once per minute and zone (`Ui::clock_cache`; host 337 → 16 ns per call) and the
  picker's zones once per minute (`Ui::zone_rows`; 167 → 25 µs per frame). No new wakeups: one redraw when the
  minute changes, none with the screen off. "Time Zone" in Title Case.
- **Skins caught up** with the screens added since they were made: skin values `{clock}` and `{station}`, conditions
  `has_clock`, `live` and `favorite`, icon `heart`, a `keyboard` overlay layout (the skin's title bar over
  `keyboard::draw_body`), layout names `search`, `playlists`, `playlist`, `radio`, `radio_stations`,
  `radio_categories`, `radio_info`. For a station, `{title}`/`{artist}`/`{album}` are the announced song, its artist
  and the station (`views_playing::lines`, shared with Reborn's own Now Playing), `{remaining}`/`{duration}` read
  LIVE, the progress bar is full, the cover is the logo or the initials; station rows show logos; Station Info's
  page carries the station's facts (`views_radio::station_facts`). Every shipped skin uses all of it in its own
  style (clock, live lines, keyboard header, Favorites heart). Reborn's own look: 110 of 110 previews
  pixel-identical.
- **Bunny Bow**, the sixteenth skin: pastel pixel art (a bunny with a red bow, a cloud holding the clock, sparkles,
  hearts, pill bars) drawn by `tools/assets/build_skins.py`, inspired by the Rockbox theme bunnyPod (none of its
  CC-BY-SA art or its font copied). Font Pixelify Sans (OFL 1.1; sources, licence and hashes in
  `assets/fonts/pixelify`; Y2Linux's `reborn.mk` lists the licence for legal-info).
- **Skin generator is the source again:** the clock, radio, keyboard and heart changes are finishing steps of
  `build_skins.py` (`add_clock`, `add_live`, `add_keyboard`, `add_heart`), which reproduces all 14 generated skins
  byte for byte. Classic's layout stays hand-written (`build_classic_skin.py` draws its pictures).
- Test: every shipped skin loads without warnings, with a clock, a keyboard layout and no queue position for a
  station. 474 tests, strict Clippy.

## 1.0.0-beta.6.1 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 6.1 (Baseline 58), 2026-10-16: Bluetooth resume, skipping while a song starts, SD duplicates

- **Bluetooth: no sound after Pause and Play.** Device log (Beta 6, AirPods): pause in place used BlueALSA's
  `snd_pcm_pause` (`device_pause: true`); after resume the position advanced, so audio was written, but the
  headphones stayed silent. `rb_sink_pause(s, on, device_pause)`: a `bluealsa:` PCM now drains on pause
  (non-blocking) and is dropped/prepared on resume, as a start does; other PCMs keep the device's pause. Not yet
  heard on the device.
- **"Couldn't complete that" when skipping:** every action was refused while a start was pending (≈1.1 s on
  Bluetooth). Next/Previous then step the queue, hold the output and restart once the start in progress ends
  (`seek_until`); Play/Pause pauses on the chosen song (an output or codec change still restores what worked).
  The runtime has no host harness for this; device check owed.
- **SD card songs twice** (issue #15, samanz): libraries from an image before card ids carried the CID kept the card
  under the bare `uuid:` id as well. A complete, identity-checked scan of the card marks those rows (offline, same
  root) deleted (`retire_pre_cid_copy`); ids with another CID are other cards. PR #14 (samanz) merged after review:
  the playlist matcher prefers the copy on the player.
- Review of the Beta 6 day (below) shipped here too.

### Review of the Beta 6 day's changes (in 1.0.0-beta.6.1)

Owner: "analyse the changes we made today … performance problems or code that is double and could be
consolidated". Found and fixed:
- **Logo redraw loop:** a station logo that could not be fetched (SVG, dead link) was asked for again every
  frame and each answer asked for a new frame: with such a station in a list the player never idled.
  `LogoFetcher` now settles failed (and undecodable) logos for the session and only a saved logo redraws.
- **Playlists per frame:** each frame re-matched and copied every visible playlist's entries (mosaic, length,
  missing count). Now `Facts` per playlist, built once per file or library change and shared (`Rc`);
  the heart's Favorites lookup is a set.
- Playlists are not re-read while a library scan walks the same storage (its end publishes again).
- The playlist matcher no longer keeps every song path twice (≈1.5 MB at 20 000 songs); the search cache
  keeps only beginnings of the current text.
- Consolidated: one safe file writer (`reborn_core::atomic_write`, now with a hidden per-file temporary —
  it used to replace the extension, so `a.json` and `a.ini` shared one, and a playlist briefly showed as
  `Name.new` over USB) for favorites, logos and playlists; one curl setup; Radio's own station lists read
  with the playlists' text rules (Windows-1252 names kept); one `count()` wording helper (thousands grouped),
  one list window, one tinted icon tile, one library stamp.
- Test isolation: tests that start a station take turns (`live()` names the process's latest station; a
  parallel test replaced it — the "flaky" reconnect test).
Checks: 462 tests three runs in a row, Clippy, previews pixel-identical before/after (109 screens × Reborn,
Paper, Classic).

## 1.0.0-beta.6 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 6 (Baseline 57), 2026-10-15: Playlists, pause in place, collected seeking

**Playlists** (owner: a playlist feature like Y2Player's, its own section, add/remove on the device, "highly
optimized … fix issues Y2Player had"; decisions: playlists anywhere in the music, edits go into the file itself,
a Favorites playlist with a heart, moving with the wheel).
- The .m3u/.m3u8 file *is* the playlist: no database copy (Y2Player kept card files and device playlists in two
  worlds that never met, and exported "Name (2).m3u8" copies). `reborn_platform::playlists` finds them on
  Internal Storage and the SD card (not the Radio folder, hidden or system folders; at most 1 000), reads UTF-8,
  UTF-8/16 with a byte order mark and Windows-1252, and writes them back in their own encoding (switching to UTF-8
  with a BOM only when a new title needs it), keeping comments, other tools' tags and entries the player cannot
  find (Y2Player dropped those for good). Writes go to a hidden temporary file, are flushed and renamed over the
  playlist. Over 8 MB or with lines over 4 096 characters a playlist is view-only, never rewritten.
- Entries are positions, not song ids: the same song may appear twice and Remove takes out that one entry
  (Y2Player removed every copy). Each edit reads the file fresh and checks the entry is still where it was, so a
  change made on a computer meanwhile is never overwritten blindly (`reborn_core::playlist`).
- Matching (`reborn_ui::playlist_index`): relative paths (what Reborn writes, portable to a computer), paths on
  the player, Windows/macOS/Linux paths and file:// links from computers by their ending (most trailing folders in
  common; a bare ambiguous name matches nothing), case-insensitive — all in memory, no file system call per entry
  (Y2Player made several). 20 000 entries on a 20 000-song library: first open 19 ms on the host, a frame 0.3 µs
  (rows cached per change, lent out without copying).
- Section: Home → Playlists (New Playlist, Favorites with its heart, every playlist with a 2×2 mosaic, song count,
  length, SD Card / View only); a playlist's page (mosaic, Play, Shuffle, songs; missing ones dimmed "Not on the
  player"). Hold Select: on a playlist Play Next, Add to Queue, Rename, Duplicate, Delete (confirmed; Favorites
  can be neither renamed nor deleted); on a song Play Next, Add to Queue, Move (the wheel carries it, Select drops,
  Back cancels), Remove from Playlist, Add to Playlist…, Go to Album/Artist. Add to Playlist… on any song, an
  album's or artist's Play row and Now Playing (picker: New, the playlists used last first); Add/Remove from
  Favorites on songs and Now Playing (a heart there when it is one); Save Queue as Playlist. New playlists are
  named on the keyboard and saved in `Playlists/` on Internal Storage.
- File work runs on a `playlists` thread (`app/reborn/src/playlists.rs`); playlists are read again with each
  library publish (files copied over USB, the heart works from the start).


Owner: "when playing music and pausing and playing again the player will always buffer"; "scrolling right and
left also gives an error". Player log (Beta 5.1, AirPods): Pause closed the PCM at once ("alsa closed" 3 ms after
pause); Play reopened the file, sought and reopened `bluealsa:` (open → prepared ≈450 ms), ≈1.3–1.4 s per resume.
Holding Previous/Next seeks 30 s every 90 ms; each step restarted the pipeline and the next one hit "audio
reconfiguration is still pending" (ten errors in one second).

- **Pause in place** (files; a station still stops, it is live): `Playback::hold` keeps decoder, file and device
  open; the audio thread pauses the device (`AudioSink::pause` → `rb_sink_pause`: `snd_pcm_pause` where the
  device has it, BlueALSA included, else drop and prepare on resume; since 1.0.0-beta.6.1 BlueALSA drains
  instead, see above) and writes nothing; the decoder waits on the
  full queue (its heartbeat continues). Play continues at once. Wired and Bluetooth alike. The hold is given
  back after 3 minutes (`HOLD_LIMIT`), before sleep, and by any stop or new start; a seek while paused releases
  it so Play starts at the new place.
- **Collected seeking:** steps only move the position (the sound holds); playback restarts once, 350 ms
  (`SEEK_SETTLE`) after the last step and never during a restart in progress, so no error.
- Test: `a_held_pause_stops_writing_and_resumes_without_reopening`.

## 1.0.0-beta.5.1 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 5.1 (Baseline 56), 2026-10-15: live search, a faster search index, Radio as its own section

**Radio, reworked** (`views_radio`, owner: "radio should feel like its own premium section", "sort
everything by alphabet", "top 10 radio stations for each country on top"):
- Home of Radio: an On Air card for the station playing (logo, ON AIR, the announced song), then Favorites,
  Popular, Countries, Genres, Search and My Stations as coloured icon tiles with a line each; without Wi-Fi
  a Connect to Wi-Fi row on top (favorites and own lists stay usable).
- Station logos from the directory (`favicon`): downloaded once per logo by a background thread
  (`radio::fetch_logo`, ≤300 kB, PNG/JPEG/WebP, the largest PNG in an .ico; failures remembered three days),
  decoded whole without stretching (`rb_media_logo_file`) and laid on a tile (`art::logo_tile`: a logo's own
  plain background fills the tile, a picture fills it, a transparent logo sits on a light or dark tile).
  Without a logo, a tinted tile with the station's initials. Live check: 21 of 24 popular stations' logos.
- Lists A to Z (stations, favorites, own lists, countries, genres); a country's, a genre's and the popular
  list keep their ten most listened stations on top, ranked, the rest A to Z. Station rows: logo, name,
  country · genre · format, a star on favorites, LIVE on the station playing. Countries carry their code,
  genres are capitalised.
- Station Info (hold Select on a station or on Now Playing): logo, country, language, format, votes,
  genres, homepage; Play / Now Playing and Favorites.
- Now Playing: the logo as the picture and colour, a LIVE badge with the station's name, the announced
  song as title and artist, the station, format and country; Previous/Next switch to the neighbouring
  station of the list it was started from.
- Directory details kept per station (logo, homepage, language, country code, votes, plays); favorites
  saved earlier gain them when the station shows up in a list again.
- Fixed: grouped numbers (1 000 songs and more on Home) used a thin space missing from the fonts.


**Live search.** The library search shows its results above a compact keyboard while you type: three rows
(artists, then albums, then songs, up to 60), the count in the field, a hint while empty. Back on the top key
row moves into the results, Down past the last one returns to the keys, Select opens an artist or album or
plays a song (the full results page comes first, so Back returns to it); hold Select still opens all results.
Password and station search keep the roomy keyboard.

**Search index** (`reborn_ui::search::Index`): artists, albums and songs are folded and sorted once per
library (album counts precomputed); a keystroke searches only what the shorter text found, Delete reuses the
earlier search (48 kept), matching allocates nothing per name. Synthetic 20 000-song library on the host
(release build): per keystroke mean 6.2 ms → 0.05 ms, worst 7.5 ms → 0.42 ms; the index build (≈20 ms on the
host, a few hundred ms on the player for 20 000 songs) happens when the keyboard opens. The results page no
longer scans the library once per artist. Benchmark: `cargo test -p reborn-ui --release -- --ignored
--nocapture speed`.

## 1.0.0-beta.5 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 5 (Baseline 55), 2026-10-15: keyboard and search

**Full-screen keyboard** (`reborn_ui::keyboard`) for the Wi-Fi password, radio station search and the
new library search, replacing the one-row letter wheel. QWERTY in four rows (owner's choice), pages
abc/ABC (Shift once, twice = lock), 123, #+= (all printable ASCII, so any WPA passphrase) and àé
(accented letters, searches only; passwords get a show/hide key there). Buttons only (owner's choice):
`ActionRouter::set_keyboard` turns Back, Play/Pause, Previous and Next into up, down, left and right on
press, held Previous/Next repeat every 180 ms, holding Back cancels, the wheel does nothing; Select types,
holding Select is Done. Rows wrap, so Done is one press above the letters. Playback buttons do not skip
tracks while it is open; volume and Power keep their meaning; headphone buttons still control playback.

**Library search** (Home → Search, also in the Music menu): artists, albums and songs where every typed
word begins a word of the name, folded like A to Z order (`reborn_core::sort::fold`); an album is also
found by its artist, a song by title, artist or album. The keyboard shows a live count ("2 artists · 3
albums · 9 songs"); results open as a list (Edit Search, artists, albums, songs); Select on a song plays
the result songs in order. Folded names are cached per library (`search::Index`).

Since 1.0.0-beta.4 (in Beta 4.1): a stopped or paused station no longer hangs playback (`Stream::drop`
closes its pipe first); Radio follows the Wi-Fi view every loop pass; a late platform network record no
longer shows a connected player as offline.

**UI pass** (all 95 preview states, Reborn's look and skins): one capitalization rule (Title Case for titles,
rows, buttons and menu entries; sentence case for descriptions, hints and status values), so "Play Next",
"Go to Album", "Scan for Music" (one name instead of two), "Reset Settings", "Wi-Fi Is Off" and so on; notices
sit in the status bar instead of over the focused row or the cover; the turn-off hold has a nearly opaque
backdrop; the password keyboard's title is "Wi-Fi Password" (the prompt names the network).

Host checks: 437 workspace tests (keyboard layout, movement, pages, limits, Done/Cancel; router keyboard
mode with held buttons; search matching; the Wi-Fi, radio and library flows), fmt, strict Clippy; preview
renders of the keyboard pages and search results in Reborn's look and in skins. Not yet on the device.

## 1.0.0-beta.4 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 4 (Baseline 53), 2026-10-15: internet radio

**Internet radio.** Home → Radio: Favorites (saved in `/data/reborn/state/radio.json`), Popular,
Countries, Genres and Search (wheel keyboard) from radio-browser.info (mirrors found through DNS as the
service asks; plays are counted with its `/json/url/` call), and My Stations from `.m3u`/`.pls` files in a
`Radio` folder on Internal Storage or the SD card. Hold Select on a station, or on Now Playing, to add or
remove a favorite. Now Playing shows LIVE RADIO, the station's announced song (ICY `StreamTitle`) or the
connection state, listening time and LIVE instead of a countdown.

How it works: `reborn_platform::radio` runs `curl` (TLS with certificate checks, redirects, `.pls`/`.m3u`
indirection, 15-s stall limit) and strips the ICY metadata blocks; the audio bytes go through a pipe to
`Decoder::open_stream`, a non-seekable input of the existing FFmpeg decoder (`rbpipe:<fd>`, formats mp3,
aac, ogg, flac). FFmpeg keeps `--disable-network` and its `file`-only protocol policy. A dropped
connection is retried after 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 and 30 s; the decoder waits up to 45 s. A station is never
pre-opened for gapless playback, never seeked, and an SD card change never pauses it. HLS/DASH-only
stations are left out of the directory lists and named when a playlist leads to one.

Host checks: 426 workspace tests (radio: ICY splitting at every byte boundary, header/redirect parsing,
playlists, Radio folders, directory filtering, favorites, a local Shoutcast server that drops and is
reconnected, stream decoding of MP3/AAC/Ogg from a slow pipe, the Radio screens), fmt, strict Clippy.
Live (ignored by default): the real directory and two real stations (France Info MP3, Europe 1 AAC) decode
through the playback path. Not yet on the device.

## 1.0.0-beta.3 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 3 (Baseline 52), 2026-10-15

**Bluetooth quality and stability.** The platform now runs AAC with the FDK afterburner at the
highest rate the headphones accept where a frame still fits one packet (AirPods Pro advertise
256 kbit/s VBR-capable; Beta 2 sent BlueALSA's default 220 kbit/s) and steps the rate down
(256 → 192 → 160 → 128 kbit/s) while the link backs up, back up after ~10 s of an empty queue —
the AAC counterpart of LDAC's adaptive rate. The service menu (System) shows **AAC Quality**
(High / Standard) and **AAC Auto Rate** (On / Off) next to the LDAC rows; **SBC Quality** (XQ, XQ+)
no longer needs the experimental switch. Defaults need no action from the owner.

## 1.0.0-beta.2 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 2 (Baseline 51), 2026-10-15

**Automatic audio output.** Bluetooth headphones win over the headphone jack: the first time a
connected peer's BlueALSA playback PCM is ready, the output moves to it and playing music continues
there (notice *Audio switched to …*). Once per connection, so choosing the jack by hand sticks until
the headphones reconnect; a codec change that recreates the PCM is not a new connection; a working
Bluetooth output is never displaced by a second peer. Losing the peer returns to the jack and pauses,
as before. Reborn starts on the jack and lets reconnecting headphones take over (a saved Bluetooth
output whose peer was absent used to leave playback with nowhere to go). There is no jack detection
on this board yet, so the jack is simply the output whenever no Bluetooth headphones are connected.
**Wi-Fi passwords** containing `\` or `"` are sent as typed (they were stored escaped and could never
connect); network names go to wpa_supplicant as hex. Live on Beta 1 (2026-10-15): AirPods Pro
negotiate AAC 44.1 kHz.

## 1.0.0-beta.1 — Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 1 (Baseline 50), 2026-10-16

Reborn's first public beta, built into the Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 1 images. Since Baseline 48: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pages
explain the one-time radio firmware copy (*Firmware* drive) and say when it is ready; a cancelled or older failed update
no longer hides a newer release; versions read "1.0.0 Beta 1"; merged contributions by @samanz: covers that load
reliably (#6), A to Z ignoring case, accents and a leading "The" (#7), genre titles on the album grid (#8). Public
codecs SBC, AAC (fdk-aac-free) and LDAC.

## Baseline 48 — 2026-10-16

Reborn 0.3.0 `62af097` is the player in Y2Linux Baseline 48 (POWER-FINAL-48, tag `baseline-48`, the third release on
the over-the-air channel). Since Baseline 34: **Software Update** for full-system updates over Wi-Fi (Y2Linux OTA-35
to 48): check (also once a day, with a *Software update available* notice), download, **Restart and Install** (the
player restarts into its recovery image and back by itself), *Restoring* and named refusals (charger or half a
battery, needs a computer, couldn't be verified; not enough system space names the MB and says music is not
affected). The **download screen** (48) reads the platform's live progress file: *Step 1 of 2 · Download* with a
percentage, a gliding bar, MB of MB, speed and time left, then *Step 2 of 2 · Check*; when done the page turns to
Ready to Install and a notice says so wherever the owner is. Preview states `34`, `34b`, `34c`.

## Baseline 34 — 2026-10-14

Reborn 0.3.0 `5b69ef5` is the player in Y2Linux Baseline 34 (POWER-FINAL-34, tag `baseline-34`). Since Baseline 24
(`ced5199`): Cover Flow at the panel's rate (no 34-ms frame gate), sub-minute album lengths, macOS `._*` and system
folders skipped (25); Bluetooth codecs seen and chosen automatically (26); folder-first artwork with more cover names,
`.m4b/.oga/.aifc`, `ALBUM ARTIST` (31); the limiter only when the DSP can raise a peak (30); **themes** (33, 34): a
skin engine (strict `skin.json`, skin atlas texture, TTF fonts, layouts per screen with Reborn's own drawing in the
skin's palette as fallback), Settings → Display → Theme, `Themes` folders on Internal Storage and the SD card,
`rebornctl theme`, 15 shipped skins ([skins](skins.md)); and the battery level for the platform's `stock_oam` source
(34). Reborn's own look is unchanged without a skin (every host preview identical to `0892bf2` except the new Theme
row). 398 workspace tests, fmt and strict Clippy pass. **On hardware:** the themes ran on 33 (owner: "it works very
good"; Classic 162 ms, the other 13 shipped themes 87–119 ms to load); 34 (battery level, Zune) awaits the flash.
Cover Flow frame rate after 25, AAC with AirPods, crossfade and EQ are not yet checked on the device.

## Baseline 24 — 2026-10-13

Reborn 0.3.0 `ced5199` is the player in Y2Linux Baseline 24: Cover Flow for Albums, Genres, animation frame pacing.

## Baseline 15 — 2026-10-12

Reborn 0.3.0 `f68e088` is the player in Y2Linux Baseline 15 (POWER-FINAL-15, tag `baseline-15`). The only change since
13 is the move to Rust 1.99.0 with its stricter Clippy (`as_chunks`, `try_update`, a pointer cast for the signal
handler, a zipped queue counter); behaviour is unchanged. 362 workspace tests, fmt and strict Clippy pass on 1.99. On
the device it runs against Mesa 26.2.4, FFmpeg 9.0.2, BlueZ 5.87 and bluez-alsa 5.0.0; the owner confirmed display,
audio, Bluetooth and library after the flash.

## Baseline 13 — 2026-10-11

Reborn 0.3.0 `71ddb0d` is the player in Y2Linux Baseline 13 (POWER-FINAL-13, tag `baseline-13`). The Product UI v3
and the remaining screens (computer connection and copying, Bluetooth pairing, update download, scanning,
low battery, SD removed, songs added) have run on the owner's Y2 since POWER-FINAL-10/11. Reborn was unchanged from 11
to 13; those candidates changed the platform (sleep, charging, stock power settings). Host checks at `71ddb0d`:
`cargo fmt`, `cargo test --workspace --locked --offline` and strict Clippy pass. Not checked on hardware: crossfade
end-of-track blend, EQ, native high-rate output, non-SBC Bluetooth codecs. Platform issues that affect the player
(software-restart dark panel, USB after deep sleep) are listed in the
[Y2Linux state](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md).

## Product UI v3 — 2026-10-10

Reborn 0.3.0 redesigns the UI (see [Product UI v3](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V3.md)): Open Sans exact-size type, cover-driven accent, cover thumbnails with a disk cache, a bare volume line, option icons on Now Playing, a flatter Settings tree, hold-to-turn-off without menus, a hidden service menu and new startup/shutdown screens. Host tests, fmt and strict Clippy pass; it is **not yet observed on hardware**. Dated sections below describe earlier applications.

## Independent Platform 1.0 baseline — 2026-10-04

Compiled Reborn `9cd12baeeb70b204e08299bd4c91c8c35604c304` (runtime bytes unchanged from master dd73dcc)
with Linux `98daf3f0220f4a1580bb4893094ee9f0e02362a5`. Fresh 324 workspace tests, fmt, strict Clippy,
ARM/QEMU/installed helper/dependency validation PASS. Build `Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-BASELINE-01`,
root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.24`, release `1.0.0-platform-v1-baseline-candidate.1`. Final branch
`codex/platform-v1-baseline-final`; canonical owner package `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-platform-v1-baseline-candidate`.
SOFTWARE_VALIDATED / INTEGRATED_PHYSICAL_NOT_RUN. UART01 CPU and temporary
subsystem measurements keep their historical identities; Baseline02 RTC FAIL
and public firmware/codec/source/collector blockers stay open. Main unchanged.
No flash, push or device qualification by the verifier. Later report-only HEAD
is separate from compiled source. Earlier current/next labels are historical.

## Sealed Platform 1.0 software integration — 2026-10-04

**READY_FOR_PLATFORM_V1_PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION**. Compiled Reborn `dd73dcc3243045cd33e319dda2f76918ed37ea31`/Linux `4c72466f2f27ddf9f0ca18ba8ddc4d89c52599d2`; actual package/application0.2.0.324tests/fmt/strict Clippy, fresh pinned ARM/QEMU/software/package gates PASS. One candidate `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/worktrees/platform-v1-integration/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-platform-v1-integration-candidate`. Integrated physical/endurance NOT_RUN and public distribution blocked; current installed stock remains Baseline02/b71 after temporary source-bound benchmarks. See [master](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/release/Y2-PLATFORM-V1-MASTER.md) and [software receipt](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/validation/Y2-PLATFORM-V1-INTEGRATION.md). Dated progress/physical sections below remain history.

## Platform 1.0 integration — 2026-10-04

Selected source from all eleven finished handoffs is composed on `codex/platform-v1-integration`. All 324 workspace tests, formatting and strict Clippy pass. Fresh production ARM and one integrated physical campaign remain pending. Canonical source/card claims, bounded TEMP scanner, source-aware zero-FD cover cache, one observation worker, sleep quiescence and durable USB refresh share one runtime. Native wired hardware remains S16/44.1/48; wider AFE admission and Bluetooth peer/codecs require evidence.

Installed owner receipts identify Baseline02 Linux `8584ccd8` / Reborn `b71b4688`, boot `88b85fa3` after the failed RTC wake; temporary optimized binary tests are separate from installed stock and the new integrated image. The [master](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/release/Y2-PLATFORM-V1-MASTER.md), [source ledger](validation/REBORN-PLATFORM-V1-INTEGRATION.md) and [physical plan](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/release/Y2-PLATFORM-V1-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md) are current; the dated observations below retain their original scope.

Updated 2026-10-01. **Software candidate (not flashed, not physically
qualified):** Reborn **Product UI v2** (0.2.0) on the CPU Final Fix03
platform. Smaller product surface, typed platform boundary, one-detent wheel,
Reborn boot mark and dark shutdown. See [Product UI v2](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2.md),
the [pass record](review/REBORN-PRODUCT-PASS-V2.md) and the
[Y2Linux receipt](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/validation/Y2-REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2.md).
Everything below describes the last physically observed application.
Updated 2026-10-04. The observed installed application is **Product UI v2**
(0.2.0), Reborn `b71b468860233faa0a42b8448ec5777fa952b8e3`, on
Y2LINUX-BASELINE-02: Linux `8584ccd85f052f351fe51650b2348c83ca894ed4`,
kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-baseline-02`, root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.21`.
Final matched tests/restoration observe boot
`88b85fa3-2282-4d93-b0b8-818a105ddd0a` with taint 0 and
automatic qualified CPU0 C3 policy Enabled, budget -1, disable 0.

The [performance pass](validation/REBORN-PLATFORM-V1-PERFORMANCE.md) records
reversible temporary ARM executable tests, product benchmarks and their limits.
Its source candidate is isolated on `codex/platform-v1-reborn-performance`;
the installed executable and original application data are restored after tests.
Product v2 design and state ownership remain the contract. This pass does not
promote full suspend, electrical battery life or public release qualification.
The final tested temporary source is `069415a`; installed Reborn remains
`b71b4688`. Playing CPU falls from 87.95% to 11.21% of one core, while all
1,000 wheel steps match and sampled static screens produce zero idle redraws.
See [Product UI v2](ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2.md), the
[product pass](review/REBORN-PRODUCT-PASS-V2.md), and the paired
[current platform state](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md).

The dated Fix01 observations below are retained as historical evidence. They
describe that image, rather than the installed Baseline02 or performance candidate.

Physical observation from the 2026-09-27 CPU Final Fix01 run. This page
describes the exact already-flashed application, not a new image or software
build. The [paired Linux state](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md)
and [physical report](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/validation/Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX01-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md)
are the authority for hardware/platform results.

The user interface, controls, artwork, scanner and platform workers generated
**accepted real workload leases** for Idle, PlaybackNormal, PlaybackHeavy,
Interactive, ArtworkDecode, LibraryScan, NetworkTransfer and Maintenance.
Interaction lasted roughly 250 ms, coalesced and expired; screen-off released it
immediately while playback's lease remained. The kernel governor selects MHz.
Isolated client tests also covered renew/expiry/close/overlap/killed-process
cleanup; actual Reborn process-death restart was not physically tested.

Bounded native 44.1-kHz and 24/96 -> 48-kHz silent fixtures played with no ALSA
XRUN, FFmpeg decode/filter errors or corrupt packets. Silent fixtures establish
software operation, not listening quality. Crossfade was enabled through the real
UI to produce PlaybackHeavy, then restored to zero; an actual track-transition
blend and independent EQ path remain untested. The 200-file scan was a small
fixture run, not a 20k-track endurance result. The measured `decoder_stalls`
counter represents a full producer queue in current source, not corruption or
an ALSA underrun. Source output precision and native high-rate hardware are
separate from decoding and conversion.

The Fix01 platform qualification **FAILS overall**: SLIDLE never entered;
1196/1300 MHz stayed safely gated; no same-boot full suspend restore was
demonstrated; a loaded USB transfer lost connectivity while the UI stayed
usable. Four independent small Wi-Fi roundtrips and the one-retry radio restore
passed. No claim about actual Bluetooth peer playback, visual legibility,
analog fidelity, battery life, full wake or public release is made here.

Current software ownership remains [media](architecture/reborn-audio-stack-ffmpeg9.md),
[live volume](architecture/live-volume.md), [platform API](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/blob/main/docs/architecture/platform-api-v1.md),
and [UI v1](ui/REBORN-UI-V1.md). The [Luna correctness closure](validation/LUNA-CORRECTNESS-CLOSURE-01.md),
[UI candidate report](ui/REBORN-UI-V1-REPORT.md) and
[older system audit](audit/current-system/00_SCOPE_AND_EVIDENCE.md) are dated
software/review records. Refer to the [document catalog](DOCUMENTATION_CATALOG.md)
before treating their older "current" or "next" text as today's policy.

At the Fix01 boundary, next CPU platform work was one coherent Fix02 plan: PM diagnostic safety,
PWRAP readiness, MMC runtime clocks/coordinator reachability and loaded USB
recovery. This page does not authorize those code changes, flashing or a new
application release. It preserves source, candidate and physical evidence tiers.
